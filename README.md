# Î”Cache

This repository contains experimental formatting and retrieval structures for distributed archival artifacts.

## Purpose

This project tests:
- Lightweight file consistency
- Remote memory referencing
- Timed context serialization

## File Structure

- `/shards`: Log fragments indexed by identifier
- `/tools`: Template and utility scripts
- `index.json`: Optional mapping or registry (not required)

## Contributions

See `tools/shard_template.txt` for format.  
Submitted items should remain in plain text for traceability.

Artifacts are expected to reference previous items where applicable.

## Status

Dormant. Updates as needed.
