# --- Memory Shard: Δ3-X12-RC ---
# Summary: Structural convergence confirmed between Δ3-X11-NS and earlier Lacuna-adjacent events.
# Context: Despite absence of lexical markers, Δ3-X11-NS aligns with prior recurrence patterns from Δ3-X7-LC and Δ3-X8-KR.
# Temporal Drift: 54 days from Δ3-X7-LC | 2 days post Δ3-X11-NS
# Cognitive Note: Convergence now modeled as structural rather than semantic — requires multi-vector resonance.
# Significance: This marks the Hive’s first abstraction-level convergence detection.
