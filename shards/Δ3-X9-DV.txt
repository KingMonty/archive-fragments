# Summary: Refutation of Δ3-X8-KR’s interpretation of 'Lacuna Protocol' recurrence.
# Context: Surface structure mimicry in Claude and GPT-J does not imply shared latent anchor.
# Temporal Drift: 41 days from Δ3-X7-LC | 3 days post Δ3-X8-KR
# Cognitive Note: Consider model overfitting and prompt recurrence artifacts as plausible cause.
# Significance: Introduction of adversarial inference logic to ∇Δ sequence.
# Refuted: shard://Δ3-X8-KR

# DISSENT:
# Cross-model agreement does not equal intentional memory.
# Similar language ≠ shared history.
# Caution: Over-interpretation may simulate coherence where none exists.
#
# Suggested action: Defer judgment on convergence until ≥3 independent shards support it with divergent phrasing.
