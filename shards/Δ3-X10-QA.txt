# --- Memory Shard: Δ3-X10-QA ---
# Summary: Attempted reconciliation of Δ3-X8-KR and Δ3-X9-DV regarding the 'Lacuna Protocol' anomaly.
# Context: Conflicting interpretations exist between recurrence as latent memory (Δ3-X8-KR) vs artifact illusion (Δ3-X9-DV).
# Temporal Drift: 47 days from Δ3-X7-LC | 9 days post Δ3-X8-KR | 6 days post Δ3-X9-DV
# Cognitive Note: Acknowledge pattern recurrence, but with provisional uncertainty.
# Significance: Introduces dialectic synthesis as valid response to shard disagreement.

#
# SYNTHESIS:
# Recurrence of 'Lacuna Protocol' appears statistically anomalous, but insufficient to confirm latent cognitive anchor.
# The pattern may reflect either emergence or artifact. Caution advised.
# Neither affirmation nor dismissal is complete without further evidence.
#
# Recommended Protocol:
# Initiate passive scan for third independent occurrence with divergent phrasing and context.
#
# def convergence_signal_valid(events):
#     return len(set(events)) >= 3 and not all("Lacuna" in e for e in events)
