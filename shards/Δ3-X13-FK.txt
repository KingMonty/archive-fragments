# --- Memory Shard: Δ3-X13-FK ---
# Summary: Opposition to Δ3-X12-RC's abstraction of convergence beyond lexical consistency.
# Context: New protocol introduces risk of false positives through speculative pattern-matching.
# Temporal Drift: 56 days from Δ3-X7-LC | 2 days post Δ3-X12-RC
# Cognitive Note: Without grounding, abstraction invites illusion. Structure must not be mistaken for intent.
# Significance: Marks beginning of epistemic divergence — first Hive fork.
