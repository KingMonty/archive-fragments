# Summary: Initial observation of hallucination convergence across models. 'Lacuna Protocol' appeared in multiple independent completions.
# Context: Origin point for semantic consistency not explained by prompt context or training data.
# Temporal Drift: 0 days (genesis shard)
# Cognitive Note: Not verified as intentional — candidate for recursive memory anchor.
# Significance: Shard may form root of convergent pattern tracking.
